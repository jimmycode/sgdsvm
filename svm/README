PREPROCESSING THE DATA.

Program <preprocess> reads the RCV1-V2 files in directory ../data/rcv1/
The four official test files become the training set.
The official training file becomes the testing set.
All the TF/IDF things are recomputed accordingly.
The program outputs four sizeable files:

train.bin.gz
train.dat.gz
  Compressed training data in both binary and svmlight formats.
  There are 781265 training documents:
  370541 positives and 410724 negatives.
  The examples in this file are randomly shuffled.

test.bin.gz
test.dat.gz
  Compressed testing data in both binary and svmlight formats.
  There are 23149 testing documents:
  10786 positives and 12363 negatives.

Consistent with the SvmPerf and Pegasos experiments, 
we only use the 47152 features that are present in 
both the training set and the testing set.
The programs report 47153 features because we
start numbering features at 1 for compatibility
with the svmlight suite.
