PREPROCESSING THE DATA.

Program <preprocess> reads the RCV1-V2 files in directory ../data/rcv1/
The four official test files become the training set.
The official training file becomes the testing set.
All the TF/IDF things are recomputed accordingly.
The program outputs four sizeable files:

train.bin.gz
train.dat.gz
  Compressed training data in both binary and svmlight formats.
  There are 781265 training documents:
  370541 positives and 410724 negatives.
  The examples in this file are randomly shuffled.

test.bin.gz
test.dat.gz
  Compressed testing data in both binary and svmlight formats.
  There are 23149 testing documents:
  10786 positives and 12363 negatives.

Consistent with the SvmPerf and Pegasos experiments, 
we only use the 47152 features that are present in 
both the training set and the testing set.
