This directory contains older variants of the basic svmsgd code.
These programs have not been updated to the sgd-2.0 standards
but should nevertheless work.

* svmcg compute the svm solution using Chapelle's primal 
  batch conjugate gradient method.

* svmsgd2 is an alternative implementation of sgd for sparse
  dataset using different schedules for the updates associated
  with the loss term and the update associated with the
  regularization term.  

* svmolbfgs is an implementation of Shraudolph's 
  online limited storage BFGS.
