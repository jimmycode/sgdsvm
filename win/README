This directory contains a visual c++ project (vc9) for compiling the svm and crf programs.
After compiling, you must copy the executables (found in the Release directory) into
their respective source code directories "svm" and "crf".

Subdirectory "zlib" contains a binary "zlib.lib" for the data compression library zlib.
This binary can be recreated from the zlib source available from "http://www.zlib.org".
